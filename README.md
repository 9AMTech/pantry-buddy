# Pantry Buddy

**-CURRENTLY UNDER MAINTENANCE-** <br> 
Pantry Buddy is a fullstack application that keeps track of your groceries based on user set expiration dates!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL

The project at the very core is a CRUD app that takes items and places them into a 3 tabled database inside MySQL. The user is meant to log into my simple sign 
in page, that takesuser data and encrypts it via a MD5 hash. After that the user can then hop into our pantry system that allows users to add groceries, view 
groceries, and edit/delete groceries. Ontop of it all the entire website is dynamic, as with PHP we store the users data into cookies that are used to make the users
experience personal, like greeting them by name when they log in!

## Optimizations

Now that I graduated college and started learning new technologies, I would definitely love to come back and rebuild this site in React when I have the time. It'll be
a good test of my skill and see how far I've come along over the years! PHP is definitely outdated technology so I feel like I'd have quite an easier time rebuilding this
with my front end web dev skillset!

## Lessons Learned:

- Reading older docs and guides to try and understand PHP code.
- Sessions are a really beautiful thing to create for the user. Seamless websites feel better to cruise.
- SQL joins are a difficult beast.
- CSS Grids are amazing!
- Learning different ways to debug your code is **CRITICAL!!!**
